//Question â€“ 1:
//        Cindy uses the services of a brokerage firm to buy and sell stocks. The firm charges 1.5% service
//        charges on the total amount for each transaction buy or sell. When Cindy sells stocks, she would
//        like to know if she gained or lost on a particular investment. Write a program that allows Cindy
//        to input the number of shares sold the purchase price of each share, and the selling price of
//        each share. The program outputs the amount invested, the total service charges, amount gained
//        or lost, and the amount received after selling the stock.
